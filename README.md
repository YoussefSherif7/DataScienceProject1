## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no extra installations required in order to run the datascienceproject1 file besides python (you should install pandas, numpy, matplotlib packages through python). Code runs on python 3 with no errors.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This is my first data science project as part of my nanodegree study on Udacity. 
The idea behind the project is to analyze trending YouTube videos in order to understand what characteristics make them trend through the US and globally. 

I attempted to answer 3 questions:
  1) What is the best time to upload a video on YouTube?
  2) Which video categories are more likely to trend?
  3) How many trending videos in the United states trend in other regions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is only 1 notebook (so far :D ) in this repository which is used to solve the previous questions. The notebook is fairly simple to understand and clearly identified with comments. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here] 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I have to give credit to Kaggle for the data set used in this analysis. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset). Thanks to the Udacity data science team for their support throughout this course so far.
